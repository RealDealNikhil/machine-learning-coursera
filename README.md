### Course taken on Coursera, taught by Andrew Ng, assignments completed by Nikhil Suri

This repository contains the completed assignments for Andrew Ng's Machine Learning course on Coursera. I took this course during summer 2018 as an introduction to Machine Learning. Below is a summary of each assignment:

* __ex1__: Linear Regression and Gradient Descent.
* __ex2__: Logistic Regression.
* __ex3__: Neural Networks and Multi-Class Classification (Forward Propagation).
* __ex4__: Neural Networks Backpropagation.
* __ex5__: Analyzing Regularized Linear Regression Models with Bias and Variance.
* __ex6__: Support Vector Machines.
* __ex7__: Unsupervised Learning with Clustering and Model Analysis with Principal Component Analysis.
